## Project task

This is a solution to the [DevProjects](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/joke-telling-bot-web-app-cjd2eyrfak). A full-fledged Joke telling robot web app using Web Speech APIs, which can be applied to both web apps and mobile apps.

## Project overview

I created a voice array that takes voices' names from synthesis.getVoices(). Then I fetched Joke API to get jokes and pass them to utterance. If a user clicks on a button for a new joke, before the previous one is finished, the previous joke stops, and a new joke will be told. Changing languages is made with options index and id. I displayed languages with the map method.
